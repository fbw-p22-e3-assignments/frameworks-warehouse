# Tooling

## Topics covered

Virtual environments and IDE.

## Goal achieved

By the end of the exercise you will have a virtual environment for your project and an IDE installed in your computer.

## Description

Create a new virtual environment. Use a recent version of Python. Make sure you can activate the environment and you are using the proper Python interpreter.

> In Linux distributions and MACOS you can see which interpreter you are using by running:
>
> `which python`
>
> In Windows you can use:
>
> `where python`

Install Visual Studio Code and the plugins.

Finally, add a section in your `README.md` file describing the development setup. Do it in your computer and then add it, commit it and push it to your remote GitHub repository.
