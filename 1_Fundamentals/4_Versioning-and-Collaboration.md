# Versioning and Collaboration

## Topics covered

Set up a repository using GitHub.

## Goal achieved

By the end of the exercise you will have created and prepared the repository for your project.

## Description

Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/), if you don't already have one.

Using the GitHub website, find out how to create a repository and create one with a `README.me` file.

Edit that file using the GitHub website and write down a description of the repository, using markdown. Explain to anyone arriving here what is this repository about. The `README.md` file is the one displayed on the front page of the repository, so it is the best place for a general description of the contents.

Include a list of the expected app features (using a list), a link to the author profile on GitHub or the home page of the Python Course.

For now, some of the features you may include are:

- A user system with roles and permissions for listing and placing orders.
- Maintain the stock of a warehouse.
- Order items from the warehouse.
- Log actions from users.
- Reporting.

You can get creative when defining intended/expected features, you can always come back to the `README.md` to define two sections, one with planned features and the other one with features already implemented.

Then, find out how to create files on the GitHub website, and create a file named `LICENSE.txt`. Go to [https://choosealicense.com/licenses/](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) and choose a license, then click on the link "View full ..." to copy the full text and copy it into yout `LICENSE.txt` file. Save the file.

Finally, edit again the `README.md` file. Add a section called license with the name of the license you chose and a link to your `LICENSE.txt` file.

Make sure all your latest changes are uploaded to the remote repository.
