# Internet & HTML

## Topics covered

HTML, CSS and GitHub Pages.

## Goal achieved

By the end of the exercise you will have published on the Internet a static home page of your project's website.

*A static page means it doesn't contain server-side programming.*

## Description

Clone your GitHub repository in your computer.

Create an `index.html` file and place it in the root of the project's repository in your computer.

Edit the file and write down the HTML code to design a basic home page for the project.

> You can open the file locally in your browser to see the rendering of your HTML and CSS code.

You can get creative when designing this page, but you can also follow these suggestions:

**Content**
- A title of the website.
- A small logo.
- A short catch-phrase.
- A "coming soon" message.
- A list of app features.
- An eye-catching picture.
- A contact link. *It can be pointing to mailto:jane_doe@example.com* or any fake e-mail.
- A table comparing your features with the competition. *Again, it doesn't need to be true data*.

**Structure**
- A header at the top: with the title and a logo.
- A footer at the bottom: with a copyright notice and a contact link.
- A main section in the middle: with picture/s, a description or catching-phrase, "coming soon", list of app features,...

**Style**

Try to design an attractive style. This may be very personal and the beauty will not be considered, but the page needs to have a custom style. Some things you can do are:

- Write your CSS code in a separate file and [link it to the HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_link.asp).
- Change the background color or use an image for the background.
- Change the font family. Use different fonts for different sections to highlight them (*the title may have a different font than the rest, or the coming soon may be different,...*)
- Use text formatting or font sizes to highlight special words you may want to prioritize in your message.
- Give a custom style to your links.
- Define CSS classes to apply the same style to common elements.
- Learn about CSS `flex` or `grid` to easily align UI elements.

> **Not enough?**
>
> *If you want to do more you can pick some of these add-ons*.
> - Check a UI framework ([Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/) or [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)). They will help you get a professionally looking style without requiring much front-end knowledge.
> - Create two pages instead, a **home** page and an **about** page with a full description of the websites features. Add a menu on both pages that lets the user jump from one to the other. Make the menu stand out.

Once you have finished with your document, add it to GIT, commit it and push it to the remote repository.

## GitHub Pages

GitHub has a static site hosting service, named **GitHub Pages**, that makes it very easy to publish a site on the Internet based on a public GitHub repository.

To do so, on the project page of GitHub's website, go to the `Settings` tab and then choose `Pages` on the left menu, then pick your `main` branch and `root` directory on the section `Source` and save it.

You can find additional information at [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).
